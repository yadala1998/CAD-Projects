Brief Description of the part: 

The model represents a light fixture that can hold a bulb and can be held in a spot with the help of screws that get attached to the bottom of the part. The fixture also makes use of Ribs that increase the strength of the part by reducing the stresses. 

Features of the Assembly and the design steps: 

Shell: The main shell is 3mm in thickness houses the center hole, ribs and the mounting pads. The shell has been created by sketching a polygon and using a revolution feature around the origin.

Slots: The slots have been extruded and subtracted from the primary shell and can allow a screw of 9mm diameter and are 20mm in length. The tolerance for this part is 1mm. All the slots are related to one parent as they’ve been duplicated with the pattern feature.

Ribs: Ribs have a thickness of 3mm and have been created by adding a datum plane and extruding a sketch using “Unit Next”. All the ribs are also related to one parent and have been duplicated with the pattern feature. 

Mounting Pads: The mounting pads have been made with the help of extrusion and subtract Boolean function and have been duplicated with the pattern feature. They allow a screw with a diameter of 2.5 mm and a depth of 6mm.
