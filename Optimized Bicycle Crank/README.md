The following model is aimed to observe how changes in volume affect the Maximum Von-Mises stress on a 
bicycle crank mechanism. The analysis and modeling has been done in NX 11.0. At the end of this experiment, 
the volume has been reduced by 51% while maintaining a factor of safety of 3.946.

Constraints:
1)	Mesh Size: 0.35 in
2)	Material: AIS 310 SS
3)	Minimum thickness around holes: 0.15
4)	Minimum Safety Factor: 2.0
5)	Yield Stress: 29,000 psi
