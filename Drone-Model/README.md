This project details regarding optimization of a drone geometry made of ABS Plastic to keep stresses under 21MPa that 
is, to have a safety factor of 2.0. For the optimization project, we used NX 11.0 and ParetoWorks on Linux computers. 

Initial Volume of Drone: 2969786.8 mm3
Volume: 517879.8632 mm3 
Volume Fraction: 517879.86/2969786.8 = 0.17
Max Von-Mises = 18.8 MPa
