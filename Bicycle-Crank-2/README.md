The following experiment has been conducted to optimize the design of a bicycle crank to decrease the volume fraction 
significantly while decreasing stresses in the material. After a series of optimizations, the volume was decreased to a 
fraction of 0.33 with max stresses of 1.3E+4 psi. 

Max Von Mises: 1.313E+4
Volume Fraction: 0.33
